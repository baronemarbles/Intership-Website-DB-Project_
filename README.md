# Intership-Website-DB-Project_


This proejct is being directed by me and my intership supervisor and we aim to create a database system that stores the company devices and that can be acessed remotelly. So it can allow 
employees of the I.T department, those who have a credential in the users database, to register, update, delete or query a specific device(s), either pulling all the informations about these devices if allowed or a specific one.

We're using pure PHP, so no frameworks so far, MYSQL and PHPmyAdmin to manage the data and database. CSS for styling purpuses And JavaScript to stablish and control the webpage behaviours. 
We're looking forward to implement new frameworks such as Laravel, React Native or other functional frameworks that would allow us to improve the flow, speed 
and connection amongst the services and its quality.

Take a look at the latest brenches/commits to see the current/last version of the code. Im still developing it and it needs a good ammount of corrections about clean code, but im on my way to achieve that.

I would love to recieve tips and advices from you guys, those who are more experienced specially. I want to learn more to be better at my craft.
All love yall.
