  <b>DISCLAIMER</b>
  <p>This repo is a clone from my <a href='https://github.com/baronemarbles/Intership-Website-DB-Project'> other repository</a> of the project, the first one. Which means that the first few versions of the code are stored there, but because of that at the time i wasn't using git, so i ended up uploading manually the features, updates etc. And moving foward to present, where i'm learning and using git, when i got to push my code into the repository(first one) it asks me if i want to merge with the content in the github repo and i tried it. But it came out with a bunch of bugs and the files were all messed up. So, i ended up creating this repo, which is a "fresher" version, so it wouldn't lead to more bugs when i'm trying to push my commits. But i'm going to fix these bugs! Just wait to see it! </p>

This proejct is being directed by me and my intership supervisor and we're aimming to create a database system that stores the company devices informations and that can be acessed remotelly. So it can allow 
employees of the I.T department, those who have a credential in the users database, to register, update, delete or query a specific device(s), either pulling all the informations about these devices if allowed or a specific one.

We're using pure PHP, so no frameworks so far, MYSQL and PHPmyAdmin to manage the data and database. CSS for styling purpuses And JavaScript to stablish and control the webpage behaviours. 
We're looking forward to implement new frameworks such as Laravel, React Native, SASS or other functional frameworks that would allow us to improve the flow, speed 
and connection amongst the services and its quality.

Take a look at the latest brenches/commits to see the current/last version of the code. Im still developing it and it needs a good ammount of corrections about clean code, but im on my way to achieve that.

I would love to recieve tips and advices from you guys, those who are more experienced specially. I want to learn more in order to be better at my craft.
All love yall.
